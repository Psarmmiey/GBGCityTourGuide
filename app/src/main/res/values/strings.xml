         <item>The Gothenburg Maritime Centre Foundation was established in 1985 with the aim of creating the worldâ€™s biggest and best maritime centre. Climb aboard and leave dry land behind you. Set sail for a brand new
                              world offering you excitement, adventure and discovery. Climb up the
                              ladders and become a part of the old tales, with the salty sea spray
                             in your face and the smell of diesel in your nostrils. Look out over
                             the harbour entrance. At Maritiman you can go to sea without ever
                             casting off.</item>
